# paths should be relative to the git path
# config should contain the following things:
#
#  - name: the job-name
#  - env : the conda environment
#  - script_path: location of the script to be executed
#  - script_config: arguments with which to run the script
#  - slurm_config: SBATCH key-value pairs

# Parallelization
# The job_builder creates a job for each possible combination of list elements.
# if you want to provide list-like data, which is should not iterate on, use tuples!
